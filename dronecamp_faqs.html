<p class="subhead">Course Requirements</p>

<p><a id="qtn_vqnnfz" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('vqnnfz');return false;">Do I need a drone?</a></p>
<p id="vqnnfz" class="answer-code">No. Drones will be provided. If you have your own drone, you are welcome to bring it for the equipment show-and-tell, but please let the organizers know in advance.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_xmulv" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('xmulv');return false;">Do I need laptop? If so, which kind?</a></p>
<p id="xmulv" class="answer-code">To complete the data processing and analysis excecises (Wednesday June 20), you will need a Windows laptop with at least 8Gb of RAM and at least 20GB hard drive space.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wwhtq" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wwhtq');return false;">I only have a Mac laptop. Will that work?</a></p>
<p id="wwhtq" class="answer-code">There's slightly older version of Pix4D for Macintosh that still works. The exercise we'll be doing however is written for the latest version of Pix4D, which is only available for Windows. Also, there is no easy way to install ArcGIS Pro on a Mac. Anyone who doesn't have a suitable laptop is welcome to work with someone else.</p>

<p class="subhead">Course Content</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wdhee" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wdhee');return false;">Will we learn how to fly a drone?</a></p>
<p id="wdhee" class="answer-code">Yes! Flight practice is part of the curriculum. Flight procedures will include equipment preparation and checks, manual launching and landing, automomous flight, and emergency procedures. In addition, students will be asked to practice on a flight simulator.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_toiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('toiuux');return false;">Which drones will we use?</a></p>
<p id="toiuux" class="answer-code">Flight practice will be small quadcopters, including the DJI Phantom III Standard and 3DR Solo. A variety of other quadcopters will be displayed and/or demonstrated, including a DJI Inspire 1, and Matrice 100.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_qtoiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('qtoiuux');return false;">Will we learn how to process RGB images or multi-spectral?</a></p>
<p id="qtoiuux" class="answer-code">Both.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_oiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('oiuux');return false;">Which software will we use?</a></p>
<p id="oiuux" class="answer-code">The main software covered include Pix4Dmapper Pro and ArcGIS. Temporary software licenses will be provided for anyone who needs one.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wswrq" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wswrq');return false;">Will this class allow me to legally fly drones for my work?</a></p>
<p id="wswrq" class="answer-code">The short answer is no. To legally fly a drone for work, research, or any other non-recreational purpose, you must have a remote pilot license from the FAA (aka Part 107). DroneCamp will introduce the FAA regulations and provide some tips for getting your remote pilot license, but this is not a Part 107 exam prep class.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_vsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('vsnla');return false;">Can we get continuing education credits for this course?</a></p>
<p id="vsnla" class="answer-code">No, but we can provide a letter with a detailed description of the curricula if that would help.</p>

<p class="subhead">Scheduling and Logistics</p>


<p><a id="qtn_wwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wwsnla');return false;">Where do we go?</a></p>
<p id="wwsnla" class="answer-code">We will be using two classrooms on the UCSD campus. For the flight practice days (Monday & Thursday), report to the Yosemite Room at the <a href="http://act.ucsd.edu/maps/?lat=32.88519602546144&lng=-117.23545993652343&t=roadmap&z=17&p=682&r=100&v=3&wid=682" target="_blank">Canyon Vista</a> community center. On Tuesday and Wednesday, everyone should come to the <a href="http://act.ucsd.edu/maps/?lat=32.88783923805805&lng=-117.24105000000002&t=roadmap&z=17&p=&r=100&v=3&wid=2111241524552318&mid=2111241524552318" target="_blank">Rady School of Management</a>, room 1S113 (1st Floor). See also <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PHBkcoH7D5Exw8tyMGEC90b_nBW5ZOTd&usp=sharing" target="_blank">this map</a>.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_zxoljay" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('zxoljay');return false;">How about parking?</a></p>
<p id="zxoljay" class="answer-code">Parking is limited so it is best to visit the UCSD <a href="http://maps.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">interactive parking map</a> for alternate locations. Typically, visitors would need to buy a parking permit at the Visitor Information Center located on North Point Drive or park at the metered parking spaces in one of the Parking Structures. You may also pay with <a href="http://transportation.ucsd.edu/parking/pay-by-app.html" target="_blank">ParkMobile</a>. Hopkins Parking Structure should have spots available. Parking at the public Torrey Pines Glider Port area is a free options as well. For information on parking with disabled person plates or placards, click <a href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/facilities/transportation/permits/disabled.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>
<span style="font-style:italic;">Please allow extra time for parking and walking to the classroom!</span></p>

<p><a id="qtn_oljay" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('oljay');return false;">Is accommodation provided? Where should we stay?</a></p>
<p id="oljay" class="answer-code">Accommodation is not provided, and on-campus housing is not an option (we checked). There are a number of hotels aronnd UC Diego. Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhrZIUPQJyK7Fpd7LrKzXECv_U8y1sQOTKYmb9vn4ug/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blanks">this list</a> for some hotels in the area.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_dbasi" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('dbasi');return false;">Why are there two flight days?</a></p>
<p id="dbasi" class="answer-code"> Due to the size of the group, half of the class will practice flying on Monday June 18, and the other half on Thursday June 21. You only have to be present for one of the flight days, not both. Flight day sign-up will be part of the registration process.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_dsbasi" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('dsbasi');return false;">What's up with the double registration process?</a></p>
<p id="dsbasi" class="answer-code">To deal with potentially more demand for the workshop than we could accommodate, we initially asked all participants to complete a short pre-registration application about your background and interests. We want to make sure the course is a good match for everyone who takes the trouble to attend. The application is no longer needed to register for DroneCamp.</p>
