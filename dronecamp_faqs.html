<h3 class="sb-mimic">Course Content</h3>

<p><a id="qtn_wdhee" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wdhee');return false;">Will I learn how to fly a drone?</a></p>
<p id="wdhee" class="answer-code">If you'd like to - yes! There will be an optional "pre-DroneCamp" workshop on basic flying on <u>Monday June 22</u>, designed for those with little to no experience with drones. On <u>Wednesday June 24</u>, there will be two workshops on more advanced flight skills, including risk assessment, emergency maneuvers, flying around obstacles, and autonomous flight.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_vqnnfz" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('vqnnfz');return false;">Do I need a drone?</a></p>
<p id="vqnnfz" class="answer-code">No. If you sign up for one of the flight sessions, drones will be provided. If you have your own drone, you are welcome to bring it for the hardware show-and-tell, but please let the organizers know in advance.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_toiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('toiuux');return false;">Which drones will we use?</a></p>
<p id="toiuux" class="answer-code">Flight practice will be with small quadcopters, including the DJI Phantom III Standard and 3DR Solo. Other UAVs that will be displayed and/or demonstrated including the DJI Inspire 1, Matrice 100, Matrice 200, eBee (fixed wing), and others.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_xmulv" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('xmulv');return false;">Do I need laptop?</a></p>
<p id="xmulv" class="answer-code">The stitching and data analysis exercises will be held in a computer lab with all the necessary software installed. If you'd like to use your own laptop for a workshop, see the workshop description for details on the type and software required.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_qtoiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('qtoiuux');return false;">Will we learn how to process RGB images or multi-spectral?</a></p>
<p id="qtoiuux" class="answer-code">Both.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_oiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('oiuux');return false;">Which software will we use?</a></p>
<p id="oiuux" class="answer-code">There will be workshops for stitching together drone images using Pix4Dmapper Pro, ArcGIS Pro, and Agisoft Metashape. Analysis workshops will use ArcGIS Pro and open source tools. See the workshop descriptions for details.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wswrq" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wswrq');return false;">Will this class allow me to legally fly drones for my work?</a></p>
<p id="wswrq" class="answer-code">The short answer is no. To legally fly a drone for any other non-recreational purpose (with a possible exception for students doing research), you must have a remote pilot license from the FAA (aka Part 107) which requires passing a written exam. There will be a workshop at DroneCamp on the Part 107 regulations, including some of the more challenging topics on the Part 107 exam such as airspace charts. This will help you prepare for the exam, but you'll need to study more and take the exam at a FAA approved test center.</p>

<h3 class="sb-mimic">Format and Workshop Materials</h3>

<p><a id="qtn_awwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('awwsnla');return false;">Can I take all the workshops?</a></p>

<p id="awwsnla" class="answer-code">Unfortunately no. In general there will be 3-4 workshops running concurrently so you'll have to pick one to attend. Workshops that are in high demand (based on a preferences survey) might be offered a second time to accommodate more people.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_avwwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('avwwsnla');return false;">Do I have to pre-register for workshops?</a></p>

<p id="avwwsnla" class="answer-code">The only workshops that require pre-reigstration are the flight practice sessions on Monday and Wednesday, which have a maximum number of people that can be accommodated. We anticipate there will be enough workstations in the two computer labs for the data processing and analysis workshops, but if needed people can pair-up.</p>


<p><a id="qtn_vavwwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('vavwwsnla');return false;">Will workshops be recorded?</a></p>

<p id="vavwwsnla" class="answer-code">There are no plans to video record workshops, however workshop materials such as slides, handouts, and exercises will be available to everyone through the conference website.</p>
