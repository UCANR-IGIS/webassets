<p><a id="qtn_vqnnfz" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('vqnnfz');return false;">Do I need a drone?</a></p>
<p id="vqnnfz" class="answer-code">No. Drones will be provided. If you have your own drone, you are welcome to bring it for the equipment show-and-tell, but please let the organizeers know in advance.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wdhee" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wdhee');return false;">Will we learn how to fly a drone?</a></p>
<p id="wdhee" class="answer-code">Yes! Flight practice is part of the curriculum. Flight procedures will include equipment preparation and checks, manual launching and landing, automomous flight, and emergency procedures. In addition, students will be asked to practice on a flight simulator.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_dbasi" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('dbasi');return false;">Why are there two flight days?</a></p>
<p id="dbasi" class="answer-code"> Due to the size of the group, half of the class will practice flying on Monday June 18, and the other half on Thursday June 21. You only have to be present for one flight day, not both. Flight day sign-up will be part of the reservation process. </p>

<p><a id="qtn_oiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('oiuux');return false;">Which software will we use?</a></p>
<p id="oiuux" class="answer-code">The main software covered include Pix4Dmapper Pro and ArcGIS. Temporary software licenses will be provided for anyone who needs one.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_xmulv" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('xmulv');return false;">Do I need laptop? If so, which kind?</a></p>
<p id="xmulv" class="answer-code">To complete the data processing and analysis excecises (Wednesday June 20), you will need a Windows laptop with at least 8Gb of RAM and at least 20GB hard drive space.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wswrq" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wswrq');return false;">Will this class allow me to fly drones for work?</a></p>
<p id="wswrq" class="answer-code">The short answer is no. To legally fly a drone for work, research, or any other non-recreational purpose, you must have a remote pilot license from the FAA (aka Part 107). DroneCamp will introduce the FAA regulations and provide some tips for getting your remote pilot license, but this is not a Part 107 exam prep class.</p>
