<summary class="qtntext">What makes DroneCamp special?</summary>
<p class="anstext">Creating 2D and 3D mapping products from drone imagery requires a relatively large number of skillsets. While there are numerous classes out there that cover regulations, flying, and/or data processing, there aren't that many programs that cover the full suite of skills (especially data processing and analytics). DroneCamp covers entire workflow, and will connect you with researchers and people just like yourself interested in converting raw data into actionable information for management and research.<br/><br/>Plus it's a lot of fun!</p>

<summary class="qtntext">Will I learn how to fly a drone?</summary>
<p class="anstext">If you'd like to - yes! There will be an optional "pre-DroneCamp" workshop on basic flying on <u>Monday June 22</u>, designed for those with little to no experience with drones. On <u>Wednesday June 24</u>, there will be two workshops on more advanced flight skills, including risk assessment, situational awareness, crew coordination, emergency procedures, and autonomous flight.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_xmulv" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('xmulv');return false;">Do I need a laptop?</a></p>
<p id="xmulv" class="answer-code">No. The stitching and data analysis exercises will be held in a computer lab with all the necessary software installed. If you'd like to use your own laptop for a workshop, see the workshop description for details on the type and software required.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_qtoiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('qtoiuux');return false;">Will we learn how to process RGB images or multi-spectral?</a></p>
<p id="qtoiuux" class="answer-code">Both.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_oiuux" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('oiuux');return false;">Which software will we use?</a></p>
<p id="oiuux" class="answer-code">There will be workshops for stitching drone images using Pix4Dmapper, Agisoft Metashape, and ArcGIS Pro. Analysis workshops will use ArcGIS Pro and open source tools. See the workshop descriptions for details.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wswrq" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wswrq');return false;">Will this course allow me to legally fly drones for my work?</a></p>
<p id="wswrq" class="answer-code">The short answer is no. To legally fly a drone for any other non-recreational purpose (with the possible exception of students doing research), you must hold a remote pilot license from the FAA (aka Part 107). This requires passing a written exam. There will be a workshop at DroneCamp on Part 107 regulations, including some of the more challenging topics on the Part 107 exam (including airspace charts). This will help you prepare for the exam, but you'll still need to study and take the exam at a FAA approved test center.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wrswrq" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wrswrq');return false;">Will the night-flying workshop allow me to legally fly a drone at night?</a></p>
<p id="wrswrq" class="answer-code">Short answer: generally yes for students and employees of the University of California who have their Part 107, and generally no for everyone else.<br/><br/>
Long answer: Flying at night requires a waiver from the FAA. The night flying workshop at DroneCamp will satisfy the training requirement to fly at night <em><strong>if</strong></em> you are covered by the University of California's night flying Certificate of Authorization (COA) from the FAA. That means you <em><strong>if</strong></em> take the workshop, <em><strong>and if</strong></em> you are covered by the UC COA (all UC students and employees are elligble), <em><strong>and if</strong></em> you have your Part 107 license, <em><strong>and if</strong></em> you install the required lighting equipment on your drone and follow all the rules, <u>then</u> you can fly legally at night.<br/><br/>
If you belong to an organization that does not have a night flying COA with the FAA, you can still take the workshop to find out what a night-flying COA is and how to get one.</p>

<h3 id="format" class="sb-mimic">Format and Workshop Materials</h3>

<p><a id="qtn_awwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('awwsnla');return false;">Can I take all the workshops?</a></p>

<p id="awwsnla" class="answer-code">Unfortunately no. In general there will be 3-4 workshops running concurrently so you'll have to pick one to attend. Workshops that are in high demand (based on a preferences survey) might be offered a second time to accommodate more people.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_abvwwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('abvwwsnla');return false;">Can I attend workshops in different tracks?</a></p>

<p id="abvwwsnla" class="answer-code">Yes, you can mix and match workshops based on your interests and the schedule.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_avwwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('avwwsnla');return false;">Do I have to pre-register for workshops?</a></p>

<p id="avwwsnla" class="answer-code">The only workshops that require pre-reigstration are the flight practice sessions on Monday and Wednesday, which have a maximum number of people that can be accommodated. For the data processing and analysis workshops, we anticipate there will be enough workstations in the two computer labs, but if needed people can pair-up.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_vavwwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('vavwwsnla');return false;">Will workshops be recorded?</a></p>

<p id="vavwwsnla" class="answer-code">There are no plans to video record workshops. However workshop materials such as slides, handouts, and exercises will be available to everyone through the DroneCamp website.</p>

<h3 id="registration" class="sb-mimic">Registration & Fees</h3>

<p><a id="qtn_ejfop" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('ejfop');return false;">I'm an alumni of UC/CSU. Am I eligible for the UC/CSU registration rate?</a></p>
<p id="ejfop" class="answer-code">Unfortunately no, the discount is only for current students and employees. Sorry.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wwwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wwwsnla');return false;">I'm a student / employee of some other university. Am I eligible for the UC/CSU registration rate?</a></p>
<p id="wwwsnla" class="answer-code">Unfortunately no, sorry.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wwwsnlaq" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wwwsnlaq');return false;">Is payment required at the time of registration?</a></p>
<p id="wwwsnlaq" class="answer-code">Payment during registration is preferred and will guarantee you a spot in the program. However if needed you can pay later. All registration fees are due 30 days before the program (i.e., May 22, 2020). People who don't pay by that time or make an alternative arrangement will get a warning and then be dropped.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wswwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wswwsnla');return false;">What forms of payment do you accept?</a></p>
<p id="wswwsnla" class="answer-code">We accept credit card, checks, and inter-campus transfer among UC campuses. If you pay by check on campus transfer, additional information will be provided on the confirmation screen.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_wswwsnlaz" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('wswwsnlaz');return false;">My organization only pays for training after its completed, so paying before the event is problematic.</a></p>
<p id="wswwsnlaz" class="answer-code">Please contact us and we'll work with you to make it work.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_twswwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('twswwsnla');return false;">What is the cancellation policy?</a></p>
<p id="twswwsnla" class="answer-code">Requests for refunds must be received in writing via email to ANR Program Support. Refunds will be less a $50 processing fee if received on or before May 31, 2020. This policy also applies to those who are paying with their UC account. Your account will be charged if you do not cancel on or before May 31.</p>

<p><a id="qtn_zwswwsnla" href="#" class="showhidelink" onclick="showHide('zwswwsnla');return false;">I am a UC ANR employee - how do I apply for a DroneCamp scholarship?</a></p>
<p id="zwswwsnla" class="answer-code">There's a question on the registration form where UC ANR employees can apply for a scholarship. After elligibility is verified, applicants will be sent a short survey to complete, after which the scholarship will be awarded. DroneCamp scholarships for UC ANR employees cover registration only, travel and accommodation are not included. Employees must have the approval of their supervisor to attend.</p>
